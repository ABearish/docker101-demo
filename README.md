# Docker 101 - Demo

A simple repo to demonstrate the building-blocks of Docker.

## Demo steps:

##### 1. Install Docker. Start Docker. Create a Dockerfile and .dockerignore file in your root directory. CD into that directory. Refer to the [Docker official docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to get started.

##### 2. Build a Docker image
```
docker build -t kapolyak/dockerdemo .
```

-t sets the image tag. Remember to precede the tag with your docker username. 
. this period is not a typo! It tells docker to include everything in this directory in the image. 

3. Run the Docker image
```
docker run -p 80:3030 -d kapolyak/dockerdemo
```

-p sets the relationship between a port on the host machine (where docker is installed) and a port on the docker container. 
-d runs the image in detached head mode, so it will continue running when you exit the terminal window.

4. Push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
```
docker push kapolyak/dockerdemo
```

We are pushing the image to dockerhub, not the container. However, we must build a container before pushing the image. 


5. Pull the Docker image to the host machine.
```
docker pull kapolyak/dockerdemo
```

6. View all Docker images 
```
docker images
```

7. Run a Docker image (create a container)
```
docker run -p 80:3030 -d kapolyak/dockerdemo
```

8. Show running Docker containers
```
docker ps
```

9. Show logs generated by code running in a container
```
docker logs [container id]
```

Pro-tip: you only need to type the first three characters of a container ID to reference that container. 

### Other important things:

Below are examples of important files to include within the root directory of the repo you plan to Dockerize:

##### Dockerfile

```
FROM node:8

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm install --only=production

# Bundle app source
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3001

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

##### .dockerignore

```
node_modules
Npm-debug.log
```

### Important Docker commands:

```
Docker system prune --all
```

Docker is non-destructive and won’t delete any containers you have previously built. This can quickly hog your machine’s storage as these containers tend to be large. There are a few different ways to clean the system, but this is the most useful one during development. Here is Docker’s own warning regarding this command:

	WARNING! This will remove:
		- all stopped containers
		- all networks not used by at least one container
		- all dangling images
		- all build cache
